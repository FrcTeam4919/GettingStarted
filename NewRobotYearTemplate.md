# Game Analysis
* Include Game Title, Notes on kickoff etc.

## Game Decomposition - Define Requirements
* Describe Game Strategies - offensive, defensive
* Describe Strategies for scoring points and ranking points
* Rank strategy options/choices - how Team Ronin wants to play the game

## Function Breakdown - Define Use Cases
* Verbs: What will the Robot, Human Players, and Operators do? Include autonomous and teleop.
* Also describe how challenging to implmenet: Green - easy, black - medium, red - hard

# Alternative Designs Brainstorming
* Remember one of the first critical items to figure out is the type of drive train. 
* Wheeled (2, 3, or 4 per side), tank track, or something else. 
* The drive train is one of first items that has to be fabricated to determine other items (functions) and how they mount and space.

## Alternative 1
* include drawings of top side and front views.
* Describe the drive, game elements and how they work in the use cases to meet the requirements.

## Alternative 2

## Alternative 3

## Alternative 4
