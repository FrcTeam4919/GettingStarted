### Final Notes for Season
* Battery 4 marked bad
* Need to replace battery 1 negative terminal nut with a nylock 
* Need to check all other batteries to replace terminal lugs with nylock
* Could shorten the 6AWG wire on the battery chargers. need to buy 4 SB-50 connectors
* Need to buy 6AWG wire stripper
* Do not use the copper screw type connecteors for attaching the wire, use crimp instead. The screws come loose, but they are OK for proto board use.
* Battery Beak from CTR can help troubleshoot and tell status of batteries. It is $80 from AndyMark.
